\section{Two Programs for Information Ecologies}

As ecological thinking moved into popular business contexts in the 1990s, two identifiable programs of information ecology (as a set of relations) were developed. The first is a managerial approach outlined as what an ecologist or a natural resource manager might call adaptive management. Davenport and Prusak suggested an "ecological" approach to information management that explicitly acknowledges the human-technology nexus and cycles of achievement. This calls for a constant re-evaluation of objectives that are moving targets. Their effort intends to improve data management in the world of corporate business. 

The second program also contains a plea to re-incorporate people into technological solutions for data management in the corporate world, but comes from the perspective of research labs and user interface design. Nardi and O'Day's work as an outcome of their time at the research labs of Apple computers and Xerox respectively provides useful insights into "information ecologies" (ecologies as relationships, not as a discipline or research). Their work can also be seen as an attempt to green the information industry and make it look more human than it was at the time of writing: it was a direct effort to make computers more friendly, more accessible, and in the end a more desirable product for everyday people.\footnote{Which history has shown to be very successful.} 

Both narratives of information ecology draw upon cognitive ecology and emphasize a moving away from a narrow technical focus on the systems for information management, which stand in for technological development, especially in the form of engineering with all of the symbolic baggage that term implies, toward a larger, contextually-dependent, vision of what information entails. Just as the cognitive ecologists wish to move away from viewing cognition as just another form of information processing, the information ecologists want to view the organization as something greater than a digital computer. 

Both approaches also share a human-machine system as organism metaphor, almost as though they are trying to understand how we have become cyborgs in our quest to use machines as memory devices \citep[cf.][]{bowker_2005}.

\subsection{Davenport Prusak}

Davenport positions the 1997 book, \textit{Information Ecology: mastering the information and knowledge environment} as an antidote to what they term the "machine-engineering" view of technology adoption and use. The intended audience is business managers who are involved in the regular operations of organizational information systems; in other words, the IT guys. Information ecology is an antidote to the engineering viewpoint because it "puts how people create, distribute, understand, and use information at its center" (ch1), instead of software design. It is an "ecological approach" to information management to counter technological approaches.

He defines Information ecology as "the science of understanding and managing whole environments" and proposes 4 basic tenants for the information ecology approach. (ch1)
\begin{enumerate}
\item information is not easily stored on computersâ€”and is not "data"
\item the more complex an information model, the less useful it will be
\item information can take on many meanings in an organization
\item technology is only one component of the information environment and often not the right way to create change.
\end{enumerate}

Davenport uses the metaphor of an organization as an information ecology transparently and justifies its weaknesses by showing how it counters the machine-engineering point of view. Indeed, he employs the metaphor to bring people back into the world of information technology. One of the principal theses oin the book is that technology alone cannot be a solution to data management problems, but that human resources, abilities, and networks are essential to improve data management in a corporate business context. A second major thesis in their book is that adaptive management approaches are necessary to sustain information systems.

In chapter 3 four key components for information ecology are introduced: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item integration of diverse types of information;
\item recognition of evolutionary change;
\item emphasis on observation and description;
\item and focus on people and information behavior.
\end{enumerate}

While the fully ecological approach to information would adopt all of these attributes, each is valuable in its own right. Adopting any of them will help organizations move in a more ecological direction.

In addition to describing the tenants and components of their information ecology approach, Davenport and Prusak acknowledge that any organization is embedded in multiple information environments. The internal company or organizational environment is the main focus of their argument, but any organization is also connected to other organizations, such as business partners, customers, and suppliers, as well as being involved in a larger environment of the marketplace. The boundaries between these environments is often fuzzy and potentially quite porous. It is interesting to note that there is no mention of the natural environment as an explicit context for an organization. This absence makes their overall program for adopting information ecologies less radical than it could potentially be [do you think this is a purposeful omission?].

The book is composed of multiple case studies, as is typical in the business management literature. Chapters in the book discuss the topic of strategy, politics, culture, staff, management, and architecture. Some of the cases are more intriguing than others. One case summarizes the information ecology approach into 5 uses for or understandings of information in an organization: truth, guidance, scarcity, accessibility, and weight. The only one of these which may be mapped easily onto biological conceptions of ecology is scarcity. Mapping the others to biological concepts would be a challenge.

\subsection{Nardi O'Day}

Nardi and O'Day share some of the same concerns as Davenport and Prusak about the impact of technology on human living, but they approach the problem from a different disciplinary perspective. Their book follows prior work in the field of anthropology for information systems design in the academic context in which the problems of "user resistance" in the adoption of new information systems \citep{star_1996}. The word ecology can be seen as an emotional appeal to make computers and the information systems in question more attractive to users.

The critique of technology based solutions to information problems is stated even more directly by Nardi and O'Day. They describe three different common perspectives on technology and society. The first is the tool view of technology which is very similar to the machine-engineering perspective mentioned by Davenport and Prusak. The tool viewpoint sees information technologies as just another item in the world of organizations which is used to accomplish tasks. The tool can be improved through better design processes but is itself morally neutral. The second view is of technology as a text which can be interpreted by scholars in order to discern the intentions and meaning of using a particular technology. The third view, and the one to which they devote most of their discussion, is the systems view.

The systems view is the strongest critique of technology based solutions to information problems. Propounded by people such as Jacques Ellul and Langdon Winner, the systems view argues that human lives are conditioned, perhaps even determined, by the technological world they inhabit. Winner, in particular, critiques three common myths about technology: that it is neutral, that it is controlled by people [not sure this is stated correctly, confusing], and that people understand the technology they use [is there a cite?]. The fact that many technologies lead to unintended consequences is prima facie evidence for the last two myths.

As a part of their research call Nardi and O'Day list a number of key ideas from ecology which they wish to apply to information.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Systemic relationships between the parts of an ecology.
\item Diversity of people and tools in an information system.
\item Co-evolution between the people and the tools in the information ecosystem.
\item Keystone species, or mediators who "build bridges across institutional boundaries and translate across disciplines" (53)
\item Locality, or the name (meaning) and habitation (location in the network/system) of a technology.
\end{enumerate}

Of great significance to "library ecosystems" is their notion of keystone species. Indeed, they name corporate librarians at Apple and Xerox as the keystone species in their particular information ecologies (as sets of relationships). Certainly this makes librarians feel important, but it also raises questions as to whether people can really be a keystone species in any ecosystem.

The key point made by Nardi and O'Day is that, although they are sympathetic to the systems critique of technology, they believe this critique is too totalizing and thus a deterrent to intervention. This idea is encapsulated in the slogan "rhetoric of inevitability" which they argue is too often part of the discussions around the effects of technology. Ecology offers a better metaphor because it is potentially more diverse than a community, draws out the importance of continual evolution, and introduces an urgency to technology discussions which can be directly linked to environmental crises. Instead of resistance to a total system, as described by Ellul or Winner, we should speak of engagement and participation, especially in the specific local situations in which each of us encounters any given technology.
