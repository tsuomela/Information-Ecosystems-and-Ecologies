The "information ecosystem" metaphor is widely used in academic libraries and has become nearly ubiquitous when speaking of the information systems that support scholarly communication and varied forms of data sharing and publication. The trending use of this language arises from non-academic applications—for example in big data (the Hadoop ecosystem) or email (the Thunderbird ecosystem)—and there remains little critical examination of the use of this metaphor. Indeed, the definition of ecosystem as the set of relations between living organisms and their surrounding non-living environment is apparently not directly a part of the metaphor. This paper interrogates the usefulness and limits of this metaphor. The paper begins with a description of the emergence of ecological thinking and how it was influenced by early information science. Then it explores how different "ecologies" are used within the academy and how they comingle with the emergent information ecology. A short critique of the metahpor is then posed by asking such questions as what are the similarities between a human constructed data assemblage and a natural ecosystem? How can the idea of contextualized communities, both human and non-human, be better expressed? What shared characteristics exist between the sustainable resource governance in ecosystem management and the management of data? The paper concludes that the information ecosystem metaphor is useful, yet at the same time there are dangerous elements that render critical aspects of human societies and natural ecosystems invisible.
