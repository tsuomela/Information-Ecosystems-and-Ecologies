\section{Conclusion}

The "information ecosystem" metaphor is a powerful way to understand complexes of data, people, and machines in a rapidly changing social and technological environment. This metaphor has been used for nearly four decades now as a way to make sense of the "data revolution" of which we are just at the beginning. Furthermore, the field of information ecology has emerged through a partial co-evolution with the "information ecosystem" metaphor. This interdisciplinary field of study is producing valuable insights into how data and information mediate the human-environment relationship and is charting paths forward both at a philosophical and practical level. The work that is coming from the engagement with the long term ecological research network (LTER) and the field of information ecology seems particularly fruitful. There is also much to learn about how to engage with the human-data-environment relationships from other ecology-based sub disciplines such as political ecology and media ecology. 

For the most part those that use an information ecology approach do not use the "information ecosystem" metaphor, instead that metaphor is mostly found in the business management literature [is their enough evidence to say this yet, or should we suggest that more research needs to be undertaken to see if this is true]. Indeed, it seems that the use of the "information ecosystem" metaphor is often more of a colloquial use and it is often hard to discern exactly what work is being done by the metaphor [often it is imprecisely used]. Furthermore there is evidence that this usage emerged from attempts to make user interfaces for information analysis, curation and sharing systems more friendly and attractive for both academic and commercial uses. We suggest that the term suggested by Kitchin, "data assemblages," is a more appropriate reference to complexes of data, people, and machines than the "information ecosystem." We also suggest that the metaphor can be more literally used and that explicit engagements with the material outcomes of the data assemblages are possible through a more explicit use. Information ecosystem work that explicitly examines these material outcomes and seeks practical solutions to mitigate negative environmental impacts is another beneficial way forward.

Finally, within research contexts there is a strong managerial thread that follows from the initial throes of information ecology and information ecosystems which parallels that of (natural) ecosystems. Much ecology research was aimed at management prescriptions for conservation, restoration, and management of natural resources. This thread was quickly adopted by corporate business managers for the management of information resources, with the more efficient management of material resources as supply chains and commodities as an underlying goal. Somewhere along the way the management of (natural) ecosystems was lost. In the academy natural resource management endures as a purpose for (geographical) research and indeed two approaches have risen to dominate the agenda: political ecology and socio-ecological systems research. Both of these programs have as an overarching goal interdisciplinary engagements; both also engage with data and information as an elementary component of (natural) ecosystems. More research is needed that focuses on this shared interest in information in the ecosystem and how our all too human management of this data and information impacts environmental outcomes. While this call is reminiscent of cultural ecology of decades gone by, the recent insights of sustainability scholars such as Ostrom, legal scholars such as Boyle, and the scholars of the various ecology-based approaches suggest that a renewed engagement of this type will produce deeper knowledge of how the human-data-environment relationship functions at scale.
