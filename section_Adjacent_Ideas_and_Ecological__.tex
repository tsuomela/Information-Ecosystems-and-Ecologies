\section{Adjacent Ideas and Ecological Adoptions}

I want to use this section of the paper to discuss some of the other disciplines that have taken up ecological ideas or themes. My hope is that this discussion may help show how information science can benefit from ecological thinking, and to possibly suggest improvements in the application of ecological ideas to the field of information science.
