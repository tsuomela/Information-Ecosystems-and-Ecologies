\section{Adjacent Ideas and Ecological Adoptions}

I want to use this section of the paper to discuss some of the other disciplines that have taken up ecological ideas or themes. My hope is that this discussion may help show how information science can benefit from ecological thinking, and to possibly suggest improvements in the application of ecological ideas to the field of information science.

Ecological concepts have been adopted by many different disciplines over the course of the twentieth century. An examination of some of these adoptions may help to illuminate the adoption of those ideas into information studies in the late 1990s.

Each of them shows how ecological concepts can be adopted by a discipline for many different purposes. Purposes which may be renegotiated at any time.
