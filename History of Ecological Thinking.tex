\section {History of Ecological Thinking}

The credit for coining the word "Ã¶kologie" is generally given to Ernst Haeckel in an 1866 publication where he suggested that this new term should refer to the broad study of nature's economy \cite{worster_1977}. This is not to suggest that ecological thinking only has a history of 160 years. If we consider a broad definition of ecology as "... the study of the structure and function of nature, it being understood that mankind is a part of nature" we can trace this lineage of though back to the origins of written history \cite{odum_1953}. Indeed, if we look to the history of thinking on nature and the environment more broadly we find that humans have grappled with three questions: what is nature's influence on man? what s man's influence on nature? and is there a grand purpose in these relationships \cite{glacken_1967}? Stated in a more ecological sense these questions can be reduced to what is the influence of the non-living environment on living organisms and what is the influence of living organisms on the non-living environment? The third question we will leave to the theoligans.
