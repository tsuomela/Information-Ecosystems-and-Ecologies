\section{Early Antecedents}

Finding a coherent program for information ecology before the publication of \cite{nardi_information_1999, davenport_information_1997} is challenging. When the term was used it appeared in disconnected places. Harris is one of the earliest examples from the business management literature. His short note on information ecology called upon researchers to recognize the dynamic interdependence of information systems within an organization, especially businesses. According to him, organizations have a state of informedness shaped by the exchange of information from both inside and outside of an organization. He analogizes this interaction between systems within an organization as a type of ecosystem in the sense that they are self-regulating, progressive, and maintain states of dynamic equilibrium. Interestingly, he likens the goals of information managers to maintain "dynamic but stable" systems to the processes found in naturally occurring ecosystems. His authority to make this claim is a 1968 study in the social sciences that draws the same conclusion: social systems maintain dynamic equilibriums much like those found in naturally occurring ecosystems. Apparently he did not read the more contemporary literature in ecology that debunked the stability hypothesis, perhaps an error passed on to later conceptions of information ecology. In any case the discussion is brief and not elaborated in any detail. \cite{harris_information_1989}.

The connection to the business and management literatures suggests another potential connection to evolutionary economics. "An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change" \cite{nelson_evolutionary_1985} is one example of ideas from the biological sciences being imported into economics. The latter work by Davenport and Prusak is perhaps the culmination of and concresence [how is this used??] of evolutionary economics and organizational science, with its concern over management information systems.

Another interesting precursor use of the phrase "information ecologies" comes from the environmental studies literature. Eryomin adduces the importance of information to the study and understanding of the environment. Information influences the formation of biosystems, the health of human beings, and our social well-being. All of these depend upon systems for valuing, storing, transmitting, and receiving information. A program for the study of information ecology would examine each of these processes, in addition to examining the criteria for information and the communities and organizations through which it flows [this must be linked to the older versions of human ecology from which the original information ecology emerged (as far as I can tell)]. For Eryomin, information ecology has the potential to be a grand synthesis between the biological sciences and the human condition through the careful study of information exchange \cite{eryomin_information_1998}. Indeed this has again been picked up very recently as an extension of the adaptive management (AM) and Panarchy literatures \cite{eddy_information_2014}. [NOTE: I think this is an interesting late development that could be included as both a call for more research in this direction in both the conclusion and the end of the "theory" section]

Broadening the search for antecedents to other ecologies that are not directly descended from the biological sciences also provides some insight. IN the discipline of anthropology there is a rich history of the development of Human Ecology and then later Cultural Ecology. Both of these anthropological sub-disciplines sought to tease out the relationships between humans and the environment with a specific focus on flows of energy and materials in small scale human societies. Particular emphasis was given to the social regulation of these flow through rules, norms, and the flow of information in the society itself. 
 
Reaching further back into the 20th century, the librarian Ranganathan suggested that as one of the five laws of librarianship the Library is a growing organism. His organismic approach included notions of growth, evolution, a touch of diversity, and some vitality. The library is alive [based on a unidentifiable Sanskrit religious metaphor] \cite{ranganathan_1931}. Perhaps not surprisingly this early information ecosystem metaphor emerged at a time when most western ecologists perceived natural ecosystems through a holistic lens as some sort of super organism (see above).
