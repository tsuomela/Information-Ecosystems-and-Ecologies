\section{Introduction}

The metaphor of the information ecosystem is widely used in academic libraries and has become nearly ubiquitous when speaking of the information systems that support scholarly communication and varied forms of data sharing and publication. The trending use of this language arises from non-academic applications—for example in big data (the Hadoop ecosystem) or email (the Thunderbird ecosystem)—and there remains little critical examination of either how this metaphor influences (open) data management practices within the academy or how these practices and the data themselves impact the natural environment \cite[although see][for initial work]{stepp_1999}. The use of this metaphor has arisen from an even more widespread "everyday vernacular where it’s [the information ecosystem] about a large network of interconnected practices" that exist both within the information technology industry and the hard to describe internet-society entanglement \cite{boyd_2016}. Whether purposefully omitted or simply an oversight in using readily available and understandable language, the definition of the ecosystem as the set of relations between living organisms and their surrounding non-living environment is apparently not directly a part of the metaphor or the vernacular use of the term.

Indeed it is often difficult to identify the intended meaning behind the use of the term. Is the speaker talking about diversity? If so, the diversity of human actors, the diversity of information, the diversity of institutional actors, or some other diversity? Is there a sustainability component? If so, which resource is a limiting factor: the supply of energy, a material thing like spinning disks, or some required “nutrient” like financial resources? Does the information ecosystem refer to an emergent behavior in complex systems akin to artificial intelligence arising from linked data? Holism? Is the reference to complex and dynamic equilibriums somehow governed by the ever-shifting interpretations of intellectual property law? Are there predator-prey relationships, such as those between publishers and authors? Is there competition in populations, be they groups of authors, academic institutions, or commercial publishing enterprises? Or are there growing and thriving communities built on shared needs? 

And the list goes on. 

This paper interrogates the usefulness and limits of this metaphor by asking such questions as what are the similarities between an (open) data assemblage and an ecosystem? How can elemental cycles and flows of energy be conceptualized in the metaphor? And finally, are there shared characteristics of sustainable resource governance in ecosystem management and the management of (open) data?  The paper describes the historical use of the information ecosystem metaphor and then explores how it is currently used within the academy. The analysis highlights the work that the metaphor does with particular attention given to how it might affect the environment. The paper concludes that the metaphor is useful and does constructive work, yet at the same time there are dangerous elements that render critical aspects of natural ecosystems invisible.
