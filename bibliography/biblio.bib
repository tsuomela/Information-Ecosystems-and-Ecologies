  shorttitle = {Information ecology},
  abstract = {In Information Ecology, Thomas Davenport proposes a revolutionary new way to look at information management, one that takes into account the total information environment within an organization. Arguing that the information that comes from computer systems may be considerably less valuable to managers than information that flows in from a variety of other sources, the author describes an approach that encompasses the company's entire information environment, the management of which he calls information ecology. Citing examples drawn from his own extensive research and consulting, including such major firms as AT \& T, American Express, Ford, General Electric, Hallmark, Hoffman La Roche, IBM, Polaroid, Pacific Bell, and Toshiba, Davenport illuminates the critical components of information ecology, and at every step along the way, he provides a quick assessment survey for managers to see how their organization measures up. He discusses the importance of developing an overall strategy for information use; explores the infighting, jealousy over resources, and political battles that can frustrate information sharing; underscores the importance of looking at how people really use information (how they search for it, modify it, share it, hoard it, and even ignore it) and the kinds of information they want; describes the ideal information staff, who not only store and retrieve information, but also prune, provide context, enhance style, and choose the right presentation medium; examines how information management should be done on a day to day basis; and presents several alternatives to the machine engineering approach to structuring and modeling information.},

  abstract = {Cognitive ecology is the study of cognitive phenomena in context. In particular, it points to the web of mutual dependence among the elements of a cognitive ecosystem. At least three fields were taking a deeply ecological approach to cognition 30 years ago: Gibson’s ecological psychology, Bateson’s ecology of mind, and Soviet cultural-historical activity theory. The ideas developed in those projects have now found a place in modern views of embodied, situated, distributed cognition. As cognitive theory continues to shift from units of analysis defined by inherent properties of the elements to units defined in terms of dynamic patterns of correlation across elements, the study of cognitive ecosystems will become an increasingly important part of cognitive science.},

I respect your post and critique of the information ecosystem but as someone who was never trained in environmental thinking, it literally didn’t dawn on me that environmental thinkers would be critical of this popular usage.

I am becoming extremely critical of the “Information Ecosystem” metaphor of which the use started several decades ago. Indeed I have written a blog and am working on a more lengthy critical engagement with this metaphor (forthcoming). Your answer would inform my thinking even more on this subject (part of my research). As an aside, at the 2015 DLF I asked Safyia U. Noble the same question (after her keynote) and had a good discussion with her. It seems that perhaps the social justice and environmental conversations have something to share in the world of data, information, and what the internet is to become.

   pages = {233-255},
   abstract = {basic premis is that ecology went through a paridigram shift in the 1950s, yet the ideas from before the shift still dominate conservationists today (1996). "Prior to the 1950s nature was simplistic and deterministic; after the 1950s nature became complex, fuzzy edged, and probabalistic." (p233)
 
 Clements (holistic approach) and Gleason (individualistic approach) - "The holistic-reductionist debate played out in the 1950s . . ." (p234)
 "Where Clements saw predictability, uniformity, cooperation, stability, and certainty, Gleason saw only individualism, competition, a blur of continuos change, and probability." (p238)
 
 Clements (also 1920s-30s)
 "The central tenent of the association-unit paridigram is that plant communities are objective reality. That is, plant species are organized into natural, recognizable units of vegetation called formations, associations, or communities, and these entities are steady-state balance points in nature that exhibit stability and constancy over time." (p234)
 - subjective, intensive sampling - the communities are an objective reality that exist outside human congnition
 - perhaps a little environmental determinism (all communities are influenced and determined by regional climate)
 - other labels: hollistic, organismic, association-unit
 
 Gleason (first publishing 1926 or so)
 " . . . each species spreads out as an independent entity, individualistically distributed according to its own genetic, physiological, and life-cycle characteristics and according to its way of relating both to the physical environment and other species." (p237)
 - associations, communities are not natural - merely constructs of the human mind
 - continuum of change
 
 Kuhnian paridigram shift from 1947 to 1959 ????
 - originally Clements' ideas dominated and Gleason was shunned in 1926 at the ESA meeting
 - post 1950, Gleasons ideas were accepted and lauded widely
 - the argument is that we went from a holistic view to a reductionist view . . . in how research was conducted and knowledge built
 - some 66% of ecologists agree that there was a shift from holistic to reductionist thinking, others think it was more along the lines of taxanomic (pre 1950) to ecosystem wide (post 1959) ecology - NOTE those outside of the USA did not see such a shift (or it was delayed [japan and USSR]). . . and that animal ecologists also did not see a shift
 
 Reflections from ecological perspective
 - both ideas can exist together (like wave-particle [turn of century-ish]) [ and really look at different scales or levels of ecology ]
 - partially issues of legibility - policy recs cannot be based on individualistic view because there is too uch information
 - the association theory can be compared to orgnized religion (Olsvig-Whittaker - one of the few scientists to switch from individualistic to holistic) "My view on the plant association is now rather like my views on organized religion - it is very practical and close enough to reality that it works most of the time even though the underlying theory is probably incorrect." (p241)
 - it was really a larger shift to objective science and away from subjective studies . .. . think especially in funding trends for research work.
 - the holistic view broke down to a certain degree as ecotypes (variations withiin species in different geographic locations) (1950s)
 - older post WWII students were very critical of Clement's ideas (with good reason some)
 - led to pluralistic thinking in ecology
 - - the 1935 introduction of the 'ecosystem' by Tansley was a part of all of this, as suggested earlier, the holistic thinking migrated to ecosystem ecology and the individualistic ideas were useful for autoecology (smaller scales) {NOTE NOT MANY PEOPLE AGREE WITH THIS NOTION ] - BOTH CONCEPTS WERE USEFUL
 - it has been suggested that Clements' ideas led Tansley to suggest the 'ecosystem' concept 
 - rise of reductionism led to the idea the the ecosystem "is more complex that we <i>can</i> think." (Frank Egler interview p 247)
 
 Reflections from social perspective
 - perhaps Clements' ideas were rooted in social sciences (Herbert Spencer and Lester Ward and seeing social systems as organisms [drawn from Lamarkian evolution] - late 19th C)
 - importance of the end of WWII and the idea that holism became unfashionable . . .
 - rise of reductionist thinking in society in general [faith in technology??]
 - cultural fragmentation pervasive (previous categorical boxes of culture and race were thrown to the wind - [reaction to racism and facism in WWII - for the better??])
 - socialism and socialist literature completely discredited in the USA (McCarthy era)
 - the me generation
 - the anti-establishment mentality
 - the shift from structural to post-structural thinking "The neat, holistic, systematic theory of language and literature called structuralism, developed by Ferdinand de Saussure, Roman Jakobson, and Claude Levi-Strauss, was giving way to an antithetical and chaotic poststructuralism that featured uncertainty in striking parallel with Heisenberg's principle from the physical sciences." (p250)
 - the McCarthy era had profound effects on what could be said at public institutions like universities . . . perhaps many people just followed a scientific livelihood and published certain ideas while they personally held other ides???
 
 Barbour is looking to the future for a synthesis of these two theories . . .
