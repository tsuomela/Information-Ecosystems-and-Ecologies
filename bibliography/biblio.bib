  abstract = {In Information Ecology, Thomas Davenport proposes a revolutionary new way to look at information management, one that takes into account the total information environment within an organization. Arguing that the information that comes from computer systems may be considerably less valuable to managers than information that flows in from a variety of other sources, the author describes an approach that encompasses the company's entire information environment, the management of which he calls information ecology. Citing examples drawn from his own extensive research and consulting, including such major firms as AT \& T, American Express, Ford, General Electric, Hallmark, Hoffman La Roche, IBM, Polaroid, Pacific Bell, and Toshiba, Davenport illuminates the critical components of information ecology, and at every step along the way, he provides a quick assessment survey for managers to see how their organization measures up. He discusses the importance of developing an overall strategy for information use; explores the infighting, jealousy over resources, and political battles that can frustrate information sharing; underscores the importance of looking at how people really use information (how they search for it, modify it, share it, hoard it, and even ignore it) and the kinds of information they want; describes the ideal information staff, who not only store and retrieve information, but also prune, provide context, enhance style, and choose the right presentation medium; examines how information management should be done on a day to day basis; and presents several alternatives to the machine engineering approach to structuring and modeling information.},

At least three fields were taking a deeply ecological approach to cognition 30 years ago: Gibson’s ecological psychology, Bateson’s ecology of mind, and Soviet cultural-historical activity theory. The ideas developed in those projects have now found a place in modern views of embodied, situated, distributed cognition. As cognitive theory continues to shift from units of analysis defined by inherent properties of the elements to units defined in terms of dynamic patterns of correlation across elements, the study of cognitive ecosystems will become an increasingly important part of cognitive science.},

Prior to the 1950s nature was simplistic and deterministic; after the 1950s nature became complex, fuzzy edged, and probabalistic. (p233)  Clements (holistic approach) and Gleason (individualistic approach) - The holistic-reductionist debate played out in the 1950s . . . (p234) Where Clements saw predictability, uniformity, cooperation, stability, and certainty, Gleason saw only individualism, competition, a blur of continuos change, and probability. (p238)  Clements (also 1920s-30s) The central tenent of the association-unit paridigram is that plant communities are objective reality. That is, plant species are organized into natural, recognizable units of vegetation called formations, associations, or communities, and these entities are steady-state balance points in nature that exhibit stability and constancy over time. (p234) - subjective, intensive sampling - the communities are an objective reality that exist outside human congnition - perhaps a little environmental determinism (all communities are influenced and determined by regional climate) - other labels: hollistic, organismic, association-unit  Gleason (first publishing 1926 or so)  . . . each species spreads out as an independent entity, individualistically distributed according to its own genetic, physiological, and life-cycle characteristics and according to its way of relating both to the physical environment and other species. (p237) - associations, communities are not natural - merely constructs of the human mind - continuum of change  Kuhnian paridigram shift from 1947 to 1959 ???? - originally Clements' ideas dominated and Gleason was shunned in 1926 at the ESA meeting - post 1950, Gleasons ideas were accepted and lauded widely - the argument is that we went from a holistic view to a reductionist view . . . in how research was conducted and knowledge built - some 66% of ecologists agree that there was a shift from holistic to reductionist thinking, others think it was more along the lines of taxanomic (pre 1950) to ecosystem wide (post 1959) ecology - NOTE those outside of the USA did not see such a shift (or it was delayed [japan and USSR]). . . and that animal ecologists also did not see a shift  Reflections from ecological perspective - both ideas can exist together (like wave-particle [turn of century-ish]) [ and really look at different scales or levels of ecology ] - partially issues of legibility - policy recs cannot be based on individualistic view because there is too uch information - the association theory can be compared to orgnized religion (Olsvig-Whittaker - one of the few scientists to switch from individualistic to holistic) My view on the plant association is now rather like my views on organized religion - it is very practical and close enough to reality that it works most of the time even though the underlying theory is probably incorrect. (p241) - it was really a larger shift to objective science and away from subjective studies . .. . think especially in funding trends for research work. - the holistic view broke down to a certain degree as ecotypes (variations withiin species in different geographic locations) (1950s) - older post WWII students were very critical of Clement's ideas (with good reason some) - led to pluralistic thinking in ecology - - the 1935 introduction of the 'ecosystem' by Tansley was a part of all of this, as suggested earlier, the holistic thinking migrated to ecosystem ecology and the individualistic ideas were useful for autoecology (smaller scales) {NOTE NOT MANY PEOPLE AGREE WITH THIS NOTION ] - BOTH CONCEPTS WERE USEFUL - it has been suggested that Clements' ideas led Tansley to suggest the 'ecosystem' concept - rise of reductionism led to the idea the the ecosystem is more complex that we <i>can</i> think. (Frank Egler interview p 247)  Reflections from social perspective - perhaps Clements' ideas were rooted in social sciences (Herbert Spencer and Lester Ward and seeing social systems as organisms [drawn from Lamarkian evolution] - late 19th C) - importance of the end of WWII and the idea that holism became unfashionable . . . - rise of reductionist thinking in society in general [faith in technology??] - cultural fragmentation pervasive (previous categorical boxes of culture and race were thrown to the wind - [reaction to racism and facism in WWII - for the better??]) - socialism and socialist literature completely discredited in the USA (McCarthy era) - the me generation - the anti-establishment mentality - the shift from structural to post-structural thinking The neat, holistic, systematic theory of language and literature called structuralism, developed by Ferdinand de Saussure, Roman Jakobson, and Claude Levi-Strauss, was giving way to an antithetical and chaotic poststructuralism that featured uncertainty in striking parallel with Heisenberg's principle from the physical sciences. (p250) - the McCarthy era had profound effects on what could be said at public institutions like universities . . . perhaps many people just followed a scientific livelihood and published certain ideas while they personally held other ides???  Barbour is looking to the future for a synthesis of these two theories . . . }}}}},

The following prospectus represents a work in progress and is the latest incarnation in a series of revisions since the first IE prospectus was developed in 1990 (Appendix B). The purpose of the prospectus is not to bound what is, admittedly, an eclectic mode of investigation, but rather to outline a field of inquiry that is inherently multidisciplinary and seeks theoretical complementarity both among disparate fields and levels of analysis. The goals are as follows: 1) to suggest some lines of inquiry and thought that might be borrowed from established disciplines and incorporated into IE; 2) to illustrate the breadth and complexity of IE as an approach to human ecology; 3) to provide impetus for establishing consensus as to the domain(s) of IE; 4) to provide an introductory document for those unfamiliar with IE; and finally 5) to present an outline of contents for a university course of study. This prospectus, like many of the Information Ecology Group’s (IEG) projects, was developed in a collaborative atmosphere with input from all participants. After initial discussions on the first hierarchical tier of the outline (Roman numerals I, II, etc.), a healthy debate filled out the remaining structure, which was then subject to further revision and updating.

  abstract = {A somewhat personal revision/criticism of Clements and Cowles' original theories of succession and climaxes in ecology (written as a strong criticism of Philip's doctrinal approach to these two concepts). First he acknowledges Cowles contribution to succession in the dunes of lake Michigan (1899) and Clements notion of the Climax (1936), but then starts to take apart the recent developments of these ideas.  On Succession: 1) Succession is a continuum of vegetational change that can proceed either forward (more complex) or backward (more simple) and can be interrupted by catastrophe 2) autogenic succession refers to changes brought upon the system by the system itself and allogenic succession refers to changes brought about by external factors (but that in reality both processes are taking place at the same time with one dominant form) 3) succession does not equal development (which infers greater complexity and stability)  On Development and the Quasi-Organism 1) debunks the use of the term organism in regards to vegetational complexes: organisms develop, vegetation passes through succession to a/the climax - suggests 'quasi-organism' as better term 2) accepts use of the term biocenoses from the 'continent' and particularly Karzinkin (1927) to refer to the vegetational complex 3) notes the relationship between the idea of a climax and dynamic equilibrium  On Climaxes 1) rejects the idea that one climax exists (the climatic climax - monoclimax theory) and suggests edaphic (soil) climaxes, physiographic climaxes, fire climax, biotic climax, mowing climax (polyclimax theory) 2) suggests that the climax concept may be flawed based on fitting facts to theory instead of testing the theory rigorosly 3) emphasises two different time scales at work in successional theory: vegetational changes (relatively short) and edaphic changes (long) 4) accepts that climaxes are 'relatively' stable  On the 'Complex-Organism' concept (Clements) 1) completely dismisses this term for the vegetational complex - too similar to higher levels of life 2) also dismisses the term community for vegetational complexes as really the vegetational complex is made of various communities (including animal) 3) accepts the term biome (biome was used by Clements) as a way to refer to larger scale associations of plants and animals 4) gets into the 'holism' concept, accepts and rejects some of it, but it leads to the . . .  Ecosystem 1) notes human need to bound things in order to study them - the boundaries do not exist in nature, but we use them to learn 2) notes long human history in philosophy (back to Lucretius) of the 'nature as organism' theory 3) but due to the mingling of living and non-living components in ecological theory suggests the term Ecosystem (note that it was not until later, Lindeman 1940's, that it became commonly used)  The fundamental concept appropriate to the biome considered together with all the effective inorganic factors of its environment is the <i>ecosystem</i>, which is a particular category among physical systems that make up the universe. In an ecosystem the organisms and the inorganic factors alike are <i>components</i> which are in relatively stable dynamic equilibruim. Succession and development are instances of the universal processes tending towards the creation of such equilibriated systems. (p 306)},

Outlines four basic concepts of the climax (stated as equal to an complex organism) [ it shoul dbe noted that what follows is not necessarily adhered to today ]: 1) there is only one climax (monoclimax theory) and it is largely dictated by climate (notes similar root in both words climax and climate) 2) the climax is stable: Man alone can destroy the stability of the climax during the long period of control by its climate . . .  (p 256) 3) climax grows/developes through primary and secondary succession, and itself originates from a previous climx (kind of like evolution) 4) climaxes are determined by dominants (species) and the associations with these dominants. There are also other minor factors in determining a climax. [ some of this seems like hodge-podge made up to fit the idea - see Tansley ]  From his 1916 paper Plant Succession: The climax formation is the adult organism, of which all initial and medial stages are but stages of development . . . A formation, in short, is the final stage of vegetational development in a climactic region. Probably also from this primary succession a series of seres called the prisere that is original (i.e. starting from barren land) and secondary succession a series of seres called the 'subsere' that originates from a disturbance in the system.  Follows with terms proclimax (a climax that is not 'the climax' but persists due to some factor - if the factor is removed the climax follows), subclimax (the community that exists before 'the' climax), disclimax (modification or displacement of 'the' climax)  clisere - the spatial series of climaxes set in motion by climactic shift. sere is but on stage in the series of development [ I assume this comes from earlier work - Plant Succession 1916? ]  preclimax and postclimax - each climax has a dual role, being preclimax to the contiguos community of so-called higher life-form and postclimax to that of a lower life-form. p 267  Dominants: dominant plant species in a climax or sere Influents: dominant animal species in a climax or sere  Then goes into naming of certain structural features of either the climax or sere (-ation for climaxes and -ies for seres): association - each biome consists of one or more associationes (associes) consociation - an association with but one dominant (consocies) faciation - subdivision of the association based on small climactic differences (facies) lociation - subdivision of the faciation based on location (locies) society - various groupings of sub-dominants (socies) clan - small units which represent a sort of ecological monopoly by one species (family)  ecotone - a mixing of dominants between two units (climax or sere) mictium - the mixed community that intervenes between seral stages or associes  panclimax - two or more related climaxes or formations in the same general climate eoclimax - the panclimax originates from the eoclimax and then differentiates . . .  In general this article seems to be a bit over the top on terms, BUT most of the terms are still in use . . . only the concepts have changed as knowledge regarding ecosystems has expanded. There also seems to be a general ignorance on the role of man as an agent in Nature . . , perhaps a sign of the times that it was written.},

The results indicate that information ecology is an emerging field with vigorous development in recent years, and information ecology research is a multi-disciplinary subject. The research also reveals that information ecology research mainly focuses on information ecosystems, information ecology in e-commerce, and information ecology in a network.
